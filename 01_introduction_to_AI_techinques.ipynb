The study of AI is based on the conjecture that **every aspect of learing or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it**.\n","\n","A way to check if a machine is intelligent is the famous [**Turing's test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test): in the standard interpretation, the interrogator, is given the task of trying to determine which player is a computer and which is a human. The interrogator is limited to using the responses to written questions to make the determination.\n","\n","Nowdays we're beyond this test because an AI can interact with the environment as well (perception, vision, movements,...). Computers should have the following abilities:\n","* Natural language processing;\n","* Knowledge representation;\n","* Automatic reasoning;\n","* Machine learning.\n","\n","Examples: Cleverbot, SIRI, Cortana, Alexa,... This bots are built indexing previous conversation, what is missing is a *state of dialogue* (coherence).\n","\n","## AI Systems Classification\n","There are two main broad classification:\n","\n","Weak AI vs Strong AI\n","* Weak AI: systems act as if they were intelligent (no true intelligence);\n","* Strong AI: systems are intelligent.\n","\n","General AI vs Narrow AI\n","* General AI: systems which are able to cope with any generalised task, like humans;\n","* Narrow AI: systems that are highly specialised in a precise task and usually perform it even better than humans (i.e. computer vision).\n","\n","## AI Approaches \n","* Symbolic: there is a symbolic representation of knowledge, the models are understandable by humans. They are **knowledge-based models** such as logic, ontologies, rule based systems,...\n","* Connesionist (or sub-symbolic): knowledge is encoded into connections between neurons, such that are not understandable by humans. Concepts are learned by examples, so they're called **data-driven models**.\n","\n","The current state of the research is to combine these two approaches together.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DD5l0PGvotMZ"},"source":["## Reasoning and Logic\n","There are of different kind and they're derived from mathematics:\n","* **Deductive reasoning**: it's just inference, we don't learn new knowledge.

The classification accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified examples out of all predictions made.\n","* **Regression**: task of approximating a mapping function from input variables to continuous output variable. These outputs are often quantities. If the input variables are ordered by time is called **time series forecasting**. The skill of a model must be reported as an error in those predictions.\n","\n","For what concerns unsupervised learning:\n","* **Clustering**: problem of organizing objects into groups whose members are similiar in some way (unalbeled data).\n","\n","Divided into:\n","* **Hard clustering**: each element can be assigned to one and only one group;\n","* **Soft clustering**: each element can belogn to more than one group.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Decision trees\n","A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.\n","---\n","\n","## Neural networks\n","The idea is to simulate the brain functioning in a computer and build an intelligent machine from artificial neurons. The first mathematical model was proposed in 1943, before the age of computers.\n","\n","A neuron receivers a set of inputs, makes a weighted sum and then applies an activation function to calculate the output. The output is controlled by an activation functon: each neuron in active if the input exceeds a certain treshold.\n","\n","Example: *linear perceptron* $y = HS(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 - \\theta)$.\n","\n","To represent more complex concepts **networks of neurons** are required. The knowledge is not explicit but inherent in the network architecture and connection weights.\n","\n","**Universal approxximation theorem**: a feed-forward network with one hidden layer and a finite number of neurons can approximate any continuous function with the desired accuracy. *It say nothing about how configure it!*\n","\n","**Deep neural networks**: neural networks with many neurons and layers (from 7 to 50). Can learn complex functions and has a computational expensive training process: the supervised algorithms get good performances with around 5000 examples for each categories and surpass humans with 10 million samples. In deep learning concepts are learn through a hierarchy of features, from the simplest to more abstract and complex. Representation is implicitly distribuited in different layers.\n","**Autoencoding**: train to reconstruct the input (unsupervised) and when it's ok freeze the weighs and adjust with examples (supervised).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Automated planning\n","Problem solving activity which consists in synthesizing a sequence of actions performed by an agent that lead from an initial state of the world to a given target state (goal).\n","\n","Given:\n","* An initial state;\n","* A set of actions you can perform;\n","* A state to achieve (**goal**).\n","\n","Find:\n","* A plan, a partially or totally ordered set of action needed to achieve the goal from the initial state.\n","\n","An **automated planner** is an intelligent agent that operates in a domain described by a representation of the initial state, a representation of the goal and a formal description of the executable actions in terms of precondition (properties that must be true before the actions) and effects. It has to dynamically defines the plan of actions needed to reach the goal from the initial state. There are several techniques: linear planning, hierarchical planning,...\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Swarm intelligence\n","Based on naturally forms of distribuited intelligence (a swarm is a collection of \"stupid\" agents):\n","* **Genetic algorithms**: spieces selection for adapting to environmental changes;\n","* **Swarm intelligence**: coordination among animals.\n","\n","In both cases there is no central coordination: a smart behaviour emerges.\n","They're robust and adaptative."]}]}
