There are different degree of support:\n","* **Data analysis for description**: data are used to describe the system, human intervention is largely needed (i.e. configuration under costraints);\n","* **Diagnosis**: uses data to understand causes, so it performs a *root cause analysis* (i.e. fault diagnosis);\n","* **Prediction**: uses data to predict future system evolutions, it performs a *what if analysis* (i.e. machine learning classification and regression);\n","* **Optimization**: to reach decision we need to select the preferred scenario, concept of objective function to minimize or maximize;\n","* (Decision automation): a step forward that excludes human intervention.\n","![](https://opsveda.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Analytics-Capabilities-Framework-Gartner-September-20131.gif)\n","\n","## Formal systems and games\n","**Minmax algorithm**: designed to define the optimal strategy for one player (max) and for suggesting the best move, hypotesizing that the other player (min) plays at his best.
